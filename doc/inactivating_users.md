# Inactivating users

When C2 users leave their positions, we no longer want to show their email
addresses as options in the approver email address dropdown when creating a
proposal.

To remove a user from the dropdown, they must be set as "inactive". This can be
done by visiting the admin panel and unchecking the "active" attribute on a user
record.
