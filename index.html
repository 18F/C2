<p>
Welcome to Communicart, a early-stage project to save taxpayer money by making government acquisition more efficient by empowering P-Card holders and GSA Advantage users to purchase as
efficiently and effectively as possible.
<h3>
The Communicart Product (so far...)
</h3>

<p>
We want to ease the communication around shopping carts by building a new object---a <em>Communicart</em>.
The Communicart combines the features of a shopping cart with the ease of an informal email conversation to create a permament, searchable, archived record of why a
a particular group of objects was purchased, and who approved the purchase.

<p>
In the future, we hope to make the Communicart the center of price research and other Market Intelligence.

<p>

To see what we have working today, you may wish to view this 10-minute video which walks through the features that we currently have implemented.

Our previous functionality, from our initial iteration, was described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8mvNfCLJQI">this video.</a>

<h3>
Our Plans
</h3>

<p>
We've been working on this project since Feburary, 2014.  Our goal is to have a very minimal, but usable product, released by the end of April, 
and then to churn and burn---to produce improvements as rapidly as we possible.

<p>
The Communicart project is actively looking for Federal P-Card holders and other procurement professionals to join our Trusted Tester program. Under this program you will be part of a select group to gain first access to the Communicart and provide direct feedback to help us refine what the Communicart tool can do. Our first step will be participating in an 1-hour phone call to get acquainted and review the current tool. Over time you will be first in line to join our launch as a beta-tester for Communicart and other products 18F aims to launch in the future.
<p>
Please contact <a href="mailto:adam@jumpassociates.com">Adam Rose</a> (&lt;adam@jumpassociates.com&gt;) to volunteer for an interview, give feedback, or for technical support.
