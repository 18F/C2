Our Plans

<p>
We've been working on this project since Feburary, 2014.  Our goal is to have a very minimal, but usable product, released by the end of April, 
and then to churn and burn---to produce improvements as rapidly as we possible.

Read</a>) of (<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov" >18F</a>) , with assitance from Adam Rose of Jump Associates and you, the users who give us feedback.

<p>
The C2 project is actively looking for Federal P-Card holders to be interviewed for one hour about their current processes and problems, to better inform our efforts.
As our prototypes transform into minimal viable products, we will be looking for early beta-testers to try out our products.
<p>
Please contact Adam Rose to volunteer for an interview, give feedback, or for technical support.
