<% title "How do I add budget codes to a request?"%>

Many requests require you to add specific budget codes as part of the approval process. The application supports three codes: a CL code, a function code, and an object field or SOC code.

You can add these after the request has been submitted by following the [Modifying Requests](./modifying_requests) process and finding the _Budget codes_ section on the edit page.

Later, if you need to change the budget information or add more, follow the same process.
