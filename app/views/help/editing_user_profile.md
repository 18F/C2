<% title "Can I add my name to my profile or change the name that shows up?" %>

Yes. If your name does not show up after you log in, we encourage you to add it. It may be easier for other people involved in your requests to recognize you by the name you use regularly than by your email address. To add yours:

1. Navigate to [your profile page](/profile). (You can also get there by clicking your email address in the upper right of any Communicart page.)
2. Add your first and last name and click _Update profile_.

If you need to edit your name — perhaps you use a different name than the one that shows up, or there is a typo — you can go back to your profile page and edit it at any time.
