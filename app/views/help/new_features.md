Welcome to the newest version of C2
We have completely redesigned the visual look of C2 and taken what we’ve learned from our users to continue improving the way it works. Here are a few things we hope you enjoy:

Consistent visual treatment
The same streamlined interface to request and approve purchase card requests, with a simple and unified visual treatment across the entire web application and email communications.


Requests Page
Side navigation
Previously, the Request Page required you to scroll down the entirety of the page to see your requests in different requests statuses. C2’s new side navigation enables you to quickly navigate to purchase requests based on the status. Quickly create a new request or access Reporting from the new side navigation.

Column visibility
One of the most requested features on the Requests page was the ability to view information relevant to a particular user role. For example, we found that requesters wanted to view different information on the Requests page than the information viewed by approvers. C2 now gives you the ability to toggle visibility of request attributes. Give it a try!

Sorting and searching
The Requests page still allows users to search for requests based on relevant attributes. Just click in the Search box to enter in your relevant information. One you get results, click on the attributes at the top of the results table to toggle sort in ascending / descending order.

Request Detail Page
The Request Detail page has undergone several changes as a result of the feedback we’ve received from C2 users. Here are the new updates:

Two-column format
The Detail Page has been divided into sections with headings, making it easier to navigate request information. The two-column format makes more information viewable at the top of the page, including the status and details information.

Improved Design of Timeline
We’ve improved the display of the Timeline area, displaying comments and request activity more clearly.

Action Bar
Relevant actions for the user are now displayed at the bottom of the Detail Page.
