### How do I submit a new credit card purchase request?

If you are a credit card holder, follow these steps:

1. [Sign in](/auth/myusa), if you aren't already.
    * If you are logged in, your email will appear in the top right.
    * When signing in, you will be directed to another application called [MyUSA](https://alpha.my.usa.gov/). Click the button that says "Connect with Google".
1. Click ["New NCR request"](/ncr/work_orders/new).
1. Fill out the form.
1. At the bottom of the form, click "Submit for approval".

That's it!

### What happens once a request is submitted?

1. The approving official (AO) that the requester specified in the form will be sent an email notification with details of the request.
1. If the approving official approves, it goes to the one or two budget mailboxes, depending on the type of request (BA61 vs. BA80, etc.).
1. Once all approvers have approved (or any one of them reject) the request, the requester gets a notification.

### What if there's something wrong with the request?

A request may need to be modified after it is submitted. These situations include:

* There was a typo.
* A different RWA number needs to be used. (BA80)
* The original request had a Not-To-Exceed amount, which needs to be changed to Exact once it's complete.

#### Approver

If you are one of the approvers and notice an issue:

1. Go to the detail page for a request.
1. Scroll down to the comment area.
1. Leave a comment, saying what needs to be changed.

Everyone involved in the request will get a notification with the comment.

#### Requester

If you are a requester, follow these steps to modify the request:

1. Go to the detail page for a request.
1. Scroll down to click the "Modify Request" button.
1. Modify the values in the form.
1. Submit the changes but clicking the button at the bottom.

At this point, everyone involved will be notified, so you don't need to send any additional message.
