<% title "How do I submit a request that exceeds $3500?" %>

The C2 system will only handle credit card requests. These requests are capped at $3,500 per vendor per job for fiscal year 2016. To submit a request exceeding the threshold, you must go through contracts with a [GSA Form 49](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/115206) to complete your request.

If your have a request that started as a credit card request, and then the scope increased beyond the $3,500 threshold, cancel the request and take your requirements through the contracting process.
