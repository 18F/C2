<% title "How do I submit a request that exceeds $3000?" %>

The C2 system will only handle credit card requests, which are capped at $3,000 per vendor per job. If you have a your request exceeding the threshold, you must go through contracts with a GSA Form 49 to complete your request.

If your have a request that started as a credit card request, and then the scope increased beyond the $3,000 threshold, cancel the request and take your requirements through the contracting process.
