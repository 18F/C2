<% title "What if I need to modify a request?" %>

You may need to modify a request after it is submitted for a number of reasons:
  - To correct a typo or other error
  - To update a Not-To-Exceed amount to a final purchase price
  - To change approval information or provide a new RWA number

## To ask for a modification

Who is eligible to modify a request depends on the rules of your region or organization. But anyone involved in a request can ask for a modification:

1. Go to the detail page for the request.
1. Scroll down to the comment area.
1. Leave a comment that explains what needs to change.
1. Click _Submit_.

Everyone involved in the request will receive a notification email with the comment.

## To modify a request directly

1. Go to the detail page for the request.
1. Scroll down to click the _Modify Request_ button.
1. Change or add the information you need to modify.
1. Submit the changes by clicking the _Update_ button at the bottom. This will overwrite the old information with your changes.

Everyone involved will receive a notification email, so you donâ€™t need to send an additional message.
