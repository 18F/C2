<% title "How do I reply to comments on purchase requests?"%>

When someone comments on a request you are involved in — whether you are the requester, an approver, or an observer — you will receive an email with the comment in it. The fastest way to reply to the comment is to reply directly to the email. This will automatically add your comment to the request.

You can also log into C2, find the request under [My Requests](../proposals), and scroll down to the _Comments_ section.
