<% title "What if I need to modify a request?" %>

You may need to modify a request after it is submitted for a number of reasons:
  - To correct a typo or other error
  - To update a Not-To-Exceed amount to a final purchase price
  - To change approval information or provide a new RWA number

## Approver

Approvers cannot modify requests, but they can ask the requester to do so. If you are one of the approvers and notice an issue:

1. Go to the detail page for the request.
1. Scroll down to the comment area.
1. Leave a comment that explains what needs to change. Click “Submit.”

Everyone involved in the request will receive a notification email with the comment.

## Requester

If you are a requester, follow these steps to modify the request:

1. Go to the detail page for the request.
1. Scroll down to click the “Modify Request” button.
1. Modify the information in the form.
1. Submit the changes by clicking the “Update” button at the bottom.

Everyone involved will receive a notification email, so you don't need to send an additional message.
