<% title "What if I need to modify a request?" %>

You may need to modify a request after it is submitted for a number of reasons:
  - To correct a typo or other error
  - To update a Not-To-Exceed amount to a final purchase price
  - To change approval information or provide a new RWA number

## To ask for a modification

Who is eligible to modify a request depends on the rules of your region or organization. But anyone involved in a request can ask for a modification:

1. Go to the detail page for the request.
1. Scroll down to the comment area.
1. Leave a comment that explains what needs to change.
1. Click “Submit.”

Everyone involved in the request will receive a notification email with the comment.

## To modify a request directly

1. Go to the detail page for the request.
1. Scroll down to click the “Modify Request” button.
1. Modify the information in the form.
1. Submit the changes by clicking the “Update” button at the bottom.

Everyone involved will receive a notification email, so you don't need to send an additional message.
