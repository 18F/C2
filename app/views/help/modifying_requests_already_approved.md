<% title "What if I modify a request that has already been approved?" %>

You can [modify a request](./modifying_requests) that has already been approved just like you do with pending requests. In some cases, however, you will need re-approval on that request.

### Modified by budget approvers

If you are a budget approver, Communicart will notify users of changes you make to approved requests. However, we still treat the approval process as complete.

### Changes by other users that require re-approval

If you are the submitters or first tier approver, you will need budget re-approval for any of these changes:

- Increasing the purchase amount
- Changing the org code, function code, or SOC code
- Changing the building number
- Changing the RWA number

When you submit one of these modifications, approvers will get two emails. The first will tell them the approved request was modified. The second will request approval of the new version of the request.

### Decreasing the purchase amount

Decreasing the purchase amount does not require re-approval. It does require notification to the budget approver that you made a change. When you modify, Communicart will send an email to let them know.
