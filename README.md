# C2

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/C2.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/C2) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/18F/C2/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/18F/C2) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/18F/C2/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/18F/C2)

For an overview of this project, please visit our [homepage](http://18f.github.io/C2/).

## INSTALLATION

In order to foster as much reuse as possible, the C2 project is a molecule of 3 repos,
each of which in theory might be reusable independently.  In practice, we on the
team need to have all three installed to have C2 function as demoed on our [homepage](http://18f.github.io/C2/).

These repos are:

* [C2](https://github.com/18F/C2) -- this repo.
* [mario](https://github.com/18F/Mario) -- the Mario repo reads email, in some cases invokes a scraper, and ultimately posts JSON back to C2.
* [gsa-advantage-scrape](https://github.com/18F/gsa-advantage-scrape) -- This is a scraper for GSA Advantage which is independently usable,
but it is used, at least in some cases, by Mario.

These three repos must be installed, and must be configured to connect to each other properly.  Although there are of course many
ways to do this, this section describes one preferred mechanism for doing this.

## Installing the scraper

Follow the instructions in the [gsa-advantage-scrape](https://github.com/18F/gsa-advantage-scrape) README.  This assumes that
you are installing with Apache, on the same machine, although you could install it some other way.

## Installing Mario

Although C2 can be used without Mario, the normal mode is to use Mario, which allows the C2 communicarts to be constructed by emails.  However, C2 has other features which allow carts to be constructed without email from arbitrary websites.  If you intend to use this approach, you don't need to install Mario.  Mario is dependent on both C2 and GSA Advantage.

## Installing C2

C2 is basically a standard rails application, so it can be installed with basic approaches.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/18F/C2.git
cd C2
```

To get the database and tests running:

1. Install Node.js 0.10
1. Start PostgreSQL.
1. Run `script/bootstrap`, which will print "DONE" if successful. *NOTE: This will delete any existing records in your database.*
    * If you have a password on PostgreSQL, it will give you an error about not being able to connect to the database. Update the info in [`config/database.yml`](config/database.yml.example) with your creds.
1. Run the specs with `bundle exec rspec spec` at the command line.
    * To run tests automatically as files are changed, run `bundle exec guard`.
    * To see previews of the mailers, run with the environment variable `MAIL_PREVIEW=true`.
1. Run the frontend tests with `grunt jasmine`.

To get the app running:

1. Register an application on [MyUSA](https://myusa-staging.18f.us/authorizations)
1. Modify [`config/environment_variables.yml`](config/environment_variables.yml.example):
    - `MANDRILL_USERNAME`
    - `MANDRILL_API_KEY` â€“ create from the [settings](https://mandrillapp.com/settings/) page
    - `MYGOV_CLIENT_ID` is the Consumer Public Key provided by MyUSA
    - `MYGOV_SECRET_ID` is the Consumer Secret Key provided by MyUSA
